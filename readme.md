As a first I created private repo with master branch. On the next step was created 3 branches:
1. develop - created index.html;
2. images - added 2 images and added them in index.html;
3. style - added style1.css and also added in index.html;
After all these steps branches images and style were merged with develop branch, testet and merged with master branch.
In result I have file - index.html with style and two images (github and devops logos).
